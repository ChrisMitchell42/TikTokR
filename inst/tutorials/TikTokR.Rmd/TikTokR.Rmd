## The Basics

Welcome to your first `lesson in R`. 

What is R you may ask? **R is a language that allows you to conduct statistics and data analysis**. R gives you a way to talk to your computer. R is more of a tool to understand data than a programming language used to build software applications for e.g. like Python. You may wonder why we are teaching you to code and this is simply because it is an employable skill that will be beneficial throughout your degree and in the future (many employers look for this skill in their graduate applicants). 


**Now the thought of coding might make you feel like this...**

**And there will be times where you will look like this**

**However by the end of this module, you will (hopefully) find this manageable!**

The aim throughout this module is to teach you skills in R which will allow you to do data science; that is, analysing, visualising and interpreting raw data which is usually from a file or database. We also want you to feel confident using R and enjoy learning something new!

<span
style = "color:red; ">What skills you will learn throughout LIFE223QS module:</span> 

1. How to import data into R
2. How to tidy data 
3. How to transform data
4. How to visualize data using computational tools (called models) in R

But firstly it is important to get to grips with R before we begin any actual statistics. 

## Exercise 1: CALCULATIONS


Lets write your first line of R code to calculate some basic math. The code you type is called a `command`, as it commands your computer to do something for you. The line you type it into is called the command line. When you type a command and press `run code`, your computer executes the command and shows you the results. 

Lets begin with basic syntax to do mathematical calculations in R. R can do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with `+ , - , * and / `. Syntax just means the structure of statements in a computer language. Mathematical operations in R follow the standard mathematical order of operations aka BIDMASS. 

<span
style = "color:red; ">*Write the R code required to multiply 5 by 2 and press 'Run Code'. You can then check your answer by pressing 'Submit Answer'. *</span>

**If you are stuck, you can press the solution button but have a go before revealing the answer!**

```{r five-times-two, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r five-times-two-solution}
5*2
```
```{r five-times-two-check}
random_praise(
  pass_if(~identical(.result, 10))
)
"Well done!"
```

You will notice a [1] appears next to your result. This just lets you know that this line begins with the first value in your result.

<span
style = "color:red; ">*Great! Now lets try a slightly trickier equation. Write the R code required to multiply 14 by 5 plus 20 divided by 2. Remember to use the appropriate syntax `(+ , - , / and *)`.*</span>

```{r fourteen-times-five-plus-twenty-divided-two, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r fourteen-times-five-plus-twenty-divided-two-solution}
14*5+20/2
```
```{r fourteen-times-five-plus-twenty-divided-two-check}
"Good job!"
```

## Exercise 2: COMMENTS

We will now show you how to tell R to ignore parts of your code. We may do this if we want to add comments and annotations to our code. Comments can help others reading the code understand it faster or it may remind ourselves why we have done a particular line of code if we were to revisit it after a certain period of time. 

Humans will be able to read the comments however your computer will pass over them. Text written in the program but not run by the computer is called a comment. R interprets anything after a # as a comment.  

<span
style = "color:red; ">*Add a comment inside this code block of how to calculate the probability of two dice being the same particular number*</span> 

```{r include=TRUE, sixth-times-sixth, exercise=TRUE}
1/6*1/6

```{r include=TRUE, sixth-times-sixth-solution}
#Probability of two dice being the same particular number
```



## Exercise 3: TYPES OF DATA

In R and programming, data types are the classifications we give different kinds of information pieces. The different types of data we will be working with throughout this module are: 

- `Numeric` --> Any number with or without a decimal point
- `Character` --> Any grouping of characters on your keyboard or text. These strings (what they're referred to in R) are surrounded by single quotes '...' or double quotes "..."
- `Logical` --> This type of data has only two possible values TRUE or FALSE (without the quotes)
- `Vectors` --> List of related data that is all the same type
- `NA` --> This type of data represents the absence of a value and is represented by the keyword NA. There can be numeric NA, character NA and a logical NA. 


```{r quiz}
quiz(caption = "Quiz")
  question("What type of data would print('TikTok') belong to?",
           answer("Numeric"),
           answer("Character", correct = TRUE),
           answer("Logical")
)           
```

You may wonder why the word print comes before TikTok. Print() is an example of a function. A function allows you to manipulate data. R comes with many functions that you can manipulate data with such as random sampling. Using a function is simple, just write the name of the function and then the data you want the function to operate on in parentheses.

The data you pass into the function is called the function's argument.
In this case, the function print('Tiktok') tells the computer to do as it says; print TikTok.  

*Have a go at printing your name as a character string*

```{r print_name_, exercise=TRUE}
print('Imogen')
```

```{r print_name_-hint}
Remember what type of data a name is!
```



## Exercise 4: OBJECTS

Now that we know how R can classify some basic types of information, we will now learn how to store them. R allows you to save data by storing it inside an R object. **What is an object?** An object is just a name that you can use to call up stored data. Wherever R encounters the object, it will replace it with the data saved inside. 

To create an object, choose a name and then use the `<` symbol, followed by a minus `-` sign to save data into it. This should look like `<-`. R will then make an object, give it your name, and store in it whatever follows the arrow. 

Let's firstly look at the tiktok data. Have a glance at the different headings there are and the sort of values that are displayed. From this TikTok data, we can use objects to group certain Tiktok creators together. For example if we wanted to look at the Tiktok creators who have more than 50 share counts on their video, we subset Tiktok creators who have a share count greater than 50 to the object tiktok_sharecount_greater_than_50 by doing this: 

<span
style = "color:red; ">tiktok_sharecount_greater_than_50 <- subset(tiktok, shareCount>=50)</span>

**Remember we have to use _ to separate words as R does not work with spaces!**


Let's break this down!
1. subset is the function which is telling the computer to unsuprisingly subset the tiktok data for those users that have a share count over 50. 
2. the arrow creates the object as mentioned above
3. tiktok is the name of the data so we need to tell the computer which data we want it to subset
4. shareCount>= 50 means to assign the values where the share count is greater than or equal to 50. 




## Lets have a go at some statistics!

**If statistics is a new concept to you or you simply want to refresh your knowledge on hypotheses and p values have a read of this PDF document before moving on:** 
[hypotheses & p values](https://liverpool.instructure.com/courses/28265/files/1388408?module_item_id=309084)

Lets use R to investigate the descriptive statistics of the tiktok dataset previously used. Let's have a go at finding the mean, median range and standard deviation. Hint - it is very simple! 

All we need to know are the functions to do this.

To find the mean, we use the function mean() and in the brackets you firstly put the name of the data followed by a $ sign and then the specific subheading of your data. for example, if we want the mean of the play count of the tiktok data we would write: 

mean(tiktok$playCount)

the titles (tiktok and playCount) has to be identical to how it is written in the data as the computer will otherwise not recognise it. 

```
```{r}

```
